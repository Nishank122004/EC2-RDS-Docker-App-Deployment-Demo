# EC2-RDS-Docker-App-Deployment-Demo#
This project showcases hands-on experience with AWS EC2, RDS, and Docker. The Node.js application runs inside a Docker container on EC2 and connects securely to a MySQL database on RDS. Ideal for learning cloud deployment, container management, and database connectivity in real-world scenarios.


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Dockerized Node.js application** deployed on **AWS EC2**, connected to an **RDS MySQL database**.  
It showcases hands-on experience with cloud deployment, containerization, and database connectivity.

**Key Objectives:**
- Deploy an application using Docker on an EC2 instance.
- Connect the application to an RDS database securely.
- Configure AWS networking (Security Groups, port mapping).
- Understand cloud-based full-stack deployment workflows.

---

## Technologies Used
- **AWS EC2** – Virtual server to host the Docker container.  
- **AWS RDS (MySQL)** – Managed relational database service.  
- **Docker** – Containerized the Node.js application for easy deployment.  
- **Node.js** – Backend application connecting to MySQL.  
- **MySQL** – Database for storing app data.

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained experience in deploying a Docker container on an EC2 instance.  
- Learned how to connect a cloud-hosted app to a managed database (RDS).  
- Configured AWS security groups and port forwarding to make the app accessible publicly.  
- Practiced real-world cloud deployment workflow with minimal cost using AWS Free Tier.

---

## Notes / Future Improvements
- Add **Docker Compose** for multi-container management (frontend + backend + DB).  
- Use **environment variables** securely instead of hardcoding DB credentials.  
- Add a **CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployment.  
- Include a **domain name & SSL** to make the app production-ready.
